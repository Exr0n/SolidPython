    # points between 0 & 1, with time never evaluated at exactly 1

    # If back_and_forth is True, smoothly animate the full extent of the motion
    # and then reverse it to the beginning; this avoids skipping between beginning
    # and end of the animated motion

    # NOTE: This is a hacky way to solve a simple problem.  To use OpenSCAD's
    # animation feature, our code needs to respond to changes in the value
    # of the OpenSCAD variable $t, but I can't think of a way to get a
    # float variable from our code and put it into the actual SCAD code.
    # Instead, we just evaluate our code at each desired step, and write it
    # all out in the SCAD code for each case, with an if/else tree.  Depending
    # on the number of steps, this could create hundreds of times more SCAD
    # code than is needed.  But... it does work, with minimal Python code, so
    # here it is. Better solutions welcome. -ETJ 28 Mar 2013

    # NOTE: information on the OpenSCAD manual wiki as of November 2012 implies
    # that the OpenSCAD app does its animation irregularly; sometimes it animates
    # one loop in steps iterations, and sometimes in (steps + 1).  Do it here
    # in steps iterations, meaning that we won't officially reach $t =1.

    # Note also that we check for ranges of time rather than equality; this
    # should avoid any rounding error problems, and doesn't require the file
    # to be animated with an identical number of steps to the way it was
    # created. -ETJ 28 Mar 2013
